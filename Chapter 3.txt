After you manage to free yourself from those guards, you start to notice that the plants are no longer too bright or different.
They are no longer unnaturally alluring and now you know that you alas managed to get out of the “Enchanted Forest”.

As you start walking away from the enchanted forest, you hear water hitting rocks.

Would you follow this sound and find out what animal it is?

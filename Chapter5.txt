As you continue on your journey towards, your destination comes into sight.
You see the outer walls surrounding your capital city, the mighty door to your birth city 
and beyond that, built on the top of a hill, your home the palace. 
The Majestic palace safely encased safely inside the strong walls of the outer fortress. 
The images of all the fond memories you have had flash through your mind.
The sight you used to see every waking moment now seemed distant and cold,
probably because of all the horrible memories of the last night you had spent there. 
What once was home was now your battle ground, the trophy you would have to win by killing so many.

You are brought back to the reality when a man wearing the uniform of an army captain comes running towards you. 
The first thing you look for are his weapons but there arent any which takes you by surprise -
army uniform but no weapons is not something typical. But you cant take any chances.
You are faced with a choice, how do you want to handle this situation? Press the number of your chosen option:

1.	Attack the man.
2.	Take a defensive stance.
3.	Do nothing.

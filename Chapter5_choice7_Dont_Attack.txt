The man stops a foot away from you. You are now sure that he isn’t there to attack you.
He looks happy to see you. He tells you that your uncle knows that you are coming. 
He tells you about Cyrus's army, and about the fact that a part of that army wants to be on your side.

He informs you that that part of the army is giong to stand on your Cyrus’s side but as soon as a signal is made, 
it will start attacking the people in Cyrus's army. The man says that he will be honoured to lead them. 
Moreover, the soldiers secretly on your side will be wearing a blue cloth around their neck. 
And after saying all this, the man goes back in the direction he appeared from.

You continue onward. In the distance you see an army of what seems like a 100 guards. You command your forces to charge.

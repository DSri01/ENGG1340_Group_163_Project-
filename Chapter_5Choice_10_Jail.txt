You call the army doctor and ask him to save your uncleâ€™s life.
The doctor applies salves on his wounds and covers them up with bandages.
He also gives Cyrus some medicines. Thereafter, you ask your guards to put Cryus in jail. 
After the fierce battle and all your struggles you finally get your reward- your kingdom.

On your coronation, you are surrounded by all your beloved friends. 
Engulfed in their love and affection you sit on the throne and wear the crown. 
Your uncle in jail, is now recovering. And your next few months are spent in nullifying all his wrong doings as a king.

In the end all returns to normal. Astonia now relishes in its former Glory with all its people dwelling in Peace.
Long live Astonia, Long live its Ruler.

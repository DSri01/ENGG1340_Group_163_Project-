Feeling tired from all that you have been through you decide to find a place to rest.
You spot a cave behind the waterfall and decide to go there. You eat some fruits and try to catch some sleep. 
A little while later you awaken to the sound of thunder and heavy rainfall. 

The downpour is too heavy and it is nearly impossible to go out so you decide to wait a little longer. 
Lying down again you spot some carvings on the walls of the cave, too orderly to be natural or made by an animal.
You see that they lead deep inside the cave. 
You follow them and realize that the cave goes deeper than you realized. You reach the end and find yourself amongst mountains. 

The height you are at is high above a valley but when you look up, the peak is higher still. 
The rain now is a drizzle and when you look down you identify a river in the valley.
You decide to climb down and go along the river because you know that it is river Katharos and it will lead to your kingdom.

You start to descend but it is hard because you slip quite often on the rocks slippery from the rain. 
You have to stop on top of a rock and figure out a better way. Choose from the immediate options that come to your mind:
Press the number of your choice:
1.	use the rope-like roots 
2.	use your weapons to stick into the crevices
3.	wait for the rain to stop completely 
4.	jump from this height hoping that the river is deep enough and you hopefully won’t hit any rocks.

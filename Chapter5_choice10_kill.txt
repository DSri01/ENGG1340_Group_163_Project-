You thrust your sword and pierce Cyrus's heart. You remember the day you saw him murder your father in front of your eyes.
You see the hatred in your uncle's eyes as he takes his last breaths. 
You see the light leave his eyes, as it did with your father. 
You finally get to avenge your father but it doesn't fill you up with satisfaction.It fills you up with hollowness and a distant sorrow. 
Seeing the man who's face so cruel and vicious when alive, now lay lifeless and sans any expression.

After the fierce battle and all your struggles you finally get your reward- your kingdom.
On your coronation, you are surrounded by all your beloved friends. 
Engulfed in their love and affection you sit on the throne and wear the crown. 
Your next few months are spent in nullifying all the wrong doings Cyrus did as a king. 

In the end all returns to normal except for the hollowness in your heart. 
The sorrow still resides there but with time it gets burried deeper and deeper till it no longer bothers you all the time. 
Astonia now relishes in its former Glory with all its people dwelling in Peace.
Long live Astonia, Long live its Ruler.

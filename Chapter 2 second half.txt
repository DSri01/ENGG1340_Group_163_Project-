No matter whatever moves you try you are not able to beat the creature.Subsequently, you try to escape but she is faster.
You try to run the other way but she beats you to it too.

But then you spot a thin root-like structure going into the ground.
Almost imperceptible, thin like a thread but nonetheless incandescent- moving with every move of the creature.
You discern that the root is the source of her power. It fit so perfectly- roots are the life of a tree.
Thus, you take the dagger that you always keep hidden in your arm and cut the root off.

The creature dissolves into a thick dense fog all around you. But as the fog fades,you hear a voice filled with gratitude
for freeing the woman who had been trapped in that vicious form for an eternity.
She wishes you good luck for your quest and rewards you with 
a mystical sword, 
5 Mythical creatures (bears, giants and griffins) and 
a new armour (equivalent to 250 men). 
Along with that your HIT POINTS = 6 and Max health = 20.

Having received the awards you continue forward on your journey. As you walk through the enchanted forest,you hear a man screaming with agony.
Would you follow the sound and trace its origin? Or you would rather continue on your path ignoring the screams of pain?

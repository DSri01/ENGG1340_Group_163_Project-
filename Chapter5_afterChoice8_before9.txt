You defeat Darius. He now rests on his knees. 
He apologises to you and begs for you to spare his life. 
He says that he was just serving the throne, no matter who sits on it. 
He was also loyal to your father, but he couldnâ€™t save him or your family when Cyrus attacked them,
and murdered them in cold blood in the darkness of the night. 
He pledges to remain loyal to you, untill his very last breath.

Now you are faced with a choice. You can either save Darius and trust his word or
distrust every word that comes out of his mout and kill him for good. Press the number of your choice:
1.  Save his life
2.  Kill him

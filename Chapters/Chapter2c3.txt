The man is really weak when you manage to get him out.
But he still manages speak up and tell you about a very rare and sacred Baccara Rose Flower.
He points towards the bushel and you spot a rose so dark-red that it almost looked black. 
You cautiously reach out and seize it. The rose is nothing like any rose you have ever seen before-
its petals thick and velvety and its leaves glowing like fluorescent ink in blacklight.
The man asks you to smell it because it has many mystery powers one of which is healing.
You both take turns smelling it-its magical aroma engulfs you- and its effect is instantaneous.
All your wounds and welts are now healed.
HEALTH REPLENISHED.
You sniff the flower again and you feel more powerful.
Health + 2 
The man lets you keep the rose as a reward for saving his life and tells you an easy way out of the forest.

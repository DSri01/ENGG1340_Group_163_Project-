You have reached the farmlands surrounding the castle.
Everyone seems to be surprised to see you.
Until now, your uncle had kept the citizens under the impression that some assassins came into the castle and killed you and your father.
You keep going forward.
You are close to a hut when suddenly an army captain comes running towards you.
The man is armed, but he is running towards you alone, with no troops in sight.

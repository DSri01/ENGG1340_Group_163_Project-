The creature dissolves into a thick dense fog all around you. But as the fog fades,you hear a voice filled with gratitude for freeing the woman who had been trapped in that vicious form for an eternity.
She wishes you good luck for your quest and rewards you with:
A mystical sword (Hit Point + 2)
A new armour (Health +10)
3 Giants and 2 Griffins (Soldiers +250)
Having received the awards you continue forward on your journey. As you walk through the enchanted forest,you hear a man screaming with agony.

The man stops just a foot away from you. Just a split-second before your weapon caresses the man, 
you realize that he didn’t mean to attack but now it’s too late to stop. 
You stab his right lung. The man is white with shock, his breath stuck in his throat as he falls.
However, you don't let him fall all the way to the ground. You hold him in your arms as he fails to support his own weight.

He tels you that your uncle knows that you are coming. He tells you about Cyrus's army, and about the fact that 
a part of that army wants to be on your side. He tries to say something important 
"The army is going...” but his sentence is left incomplete. The man takes his last labored breath, closes his eyes and dies in your arms.
You killed a man who came in faith to help you and the guilt of this unfortunate event is a burden you have to bear for your entire life alone.
